## General Introduction ##

Stg# is the new generation STG game engine. STG# is written in C# and runs on .NET platform.

The Stg# engine contains three parts:

1. A high efficiency math library
2. A timeline manager and game producers' API
3. A game resource manager

Timeline of Stg# is controlled by a new type of scipt language called SGSL(Shooting Game Script Language). SGSL allows developers to manage files and debug in an reletively easy mod. Developers edit games in different "Organizations", which can be devided into "Generatings" and "Processings", which defines how bollet creats and move.

The math library contains four parts:

1. A scalar math library
2. A linear vector library
3. A geometry library

Early version of Stg# Math Library use C# to calculate, but is relatively low in efficiency and accuracy. In future versions, the math library will be optimaized by useing SSE Instructions.

## Install ##

Stg# have not been completed yet, so no release packages are provided now.
